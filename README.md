# Functions that don't work:
If you have any imformation about this, please contact me.
- Filament Sensor : Its a ribbon cable with a linear hall sensor (detects magnets and is analoge)
- Display : (Unidentified Ribbon cable, bbl says on a1m page that its 4spi)
- AMS lite : Closed Source (possibly openamsl, or get open source mmu) 
- Heated Bed : I am unable to get a solid state relay currently, but it is really easy to do.
- Solid state relay board, it is controlled by a ribbon cable by 8, idk pinout.

# PCBing:
I am currently working on some pcbs, the mainboard and toolhead board are nearly done but are encoutering some issues in development.
I will purchase through jlcpcb, the toolhead board price for 2 boards is around 60 aud without shipping.

# Current Progress
This is my 2nd print (voron cube first), the part cooling fan wasn't working in it and there was a layer shift.
